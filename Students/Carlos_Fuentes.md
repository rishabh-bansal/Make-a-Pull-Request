# Carlos Fuentes

## Hi

My name is Carlos Fuentes, I'm a graduated from my BS Administrative Computer Science. I'm living in Tecate, Mexico. I'm a huge fan of video-games and solve problems with code.

Right now, I'm focus on Back-end development with Node.js as main environment. I'm a Javascript lover and how this incredible and uncontrollable language are growing up so fast and how is applying to incredible areas like IoT and even IA.
I'm looking to begin with IA the next year with Python, I'm a huge fan of IA and want to work with that tech in the future.

I'm the kind of guy who loves to grows one step at time and enjoy the entire trip not only the finish line. I love my mistakes because make me grow my skills and forces me to put my feet's on the ground to understand how long from my goal am I and work harder to accomplish my dreams.

I'm really introvert and I become really nervous when I need to talk with new people and more if is in another language like English. But, when I become to talk I never finish.
I love the superhero movies, Sci-Fi, Action, Thriller and any other movie that can make my mind blow up.

I started with my Digital CV, so stay in touch to know when is ready.
